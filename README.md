## Purpose

This is a weekly coding challenge for the UNCC full stack bootcamp. The assignment was to build a day planner application that allows the user to add and save appointments in their web browser. I used dayjs to get the local time and then saved the appointments to the browser's localStorage.

The user can input appointments by clicking on the body of one of the time slots and typing their appointment name.

The appointments are saved by clicking the blue save icon next to each timeslot.
